# Introduction

## Why Headless Chart?

Have you ever had these concerns when creating charts?

- "This chart library has great features, but it doesn't match our design system..."
- "The customization options are too limited"
- "Building from scratch would take too much time..."

**Headless Chart** was created to solve exactly these problems.

## What is Headless?

"Headless" means providing only the logic without the UI. Headless Chart:

- ‚úÖ **Provides core chart logic** (data calculations, scales, layouts)
- ‚úÖ **You decide the design** (colors, shapes, animations)
- ‚úÖ **Fully customizable** (all components are replaceable)

## Widget System Based on Flitter

Headless Chart is built on the [Flitter](https://github.com/meursyphus/flitter) framework. Flitter implements Flutter's widget system for the web with these characteristics:

- **Declarative UI**: Declare the UI appearance rather than state
- **Composition-based**: Build complex UI by composing small widgets
- **Cross-renderer**: Supports both SVG and Canvas

## Difference from Traditional Chart Libraries

### Traditional Chart Libraries
```javascript
// Customization through options
new Chart({
  type: 'bar',
  options: {
    color: 'blue',
    borderWidth: 2,
    // Limited options...
  }
})
```

### Headless Chart
```javascript
// Directly replace components
BarChart({
  data: myData,
  custom: {
    bar: MyCustomBar,      // Your custom bar
    axis: MyCustomAxis,    // Your custom axis
    legend: MyCustomLegend // Your custom legend
  }
})
```

## Key Benefits

### 1. Complete Design Freedom
Customize every element exactly as you want. Perfect for matching your company's design system.

### 2. Progressive Customization
Start with default components and replace only what you need, one by one.

### 3. Type Safety
Written in TypeScript with complete type support.

### 4. Framework Independent
Works with React, Svelte, Vue, or any other framework.
